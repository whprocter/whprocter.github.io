This is a reproduction study that I conducted of Malcomb et al. 2014.  I sought to determine whether the original Malcomb study could be reproduced using an open-source approach with open source software and easily-accessible data sources.  You can access my reproduction (here)[

Specifically, this reproduction sught to replicate the original multi-criteria analysis of vulnerability to climate change in Malawi, using figures 4 and 5 as primary outputs. The reproduction of Figure 4, representing the map of adaptive capacity by traditional authority in 2010, revealed consistent overestimation issues, particularly in the northern coastal areas. The Spearman's rank correlation indicated a moderately strong positive but imperfect correlation between the original and reproduced values. Significant discrepancies in adaptive capacity scores, especially in the southernmost part of the country, raised concerns about the reproducibility and internal validity of the study.

The reproduction of Figure 5, representing the map of vulnerability in Malawi, highlighted a consistent undercounting issue, with vulnerability values about 20% lower than the original. The Spearman's rank correlation for vulnerability was notably weaker than that for adaptive capacity, indicating more substantial discrepancies. The discussion emphasized potential sources of error, including georeferencing problems, unaccounted-for lake/park chunks, normalization errors, differences in computational environments, or human error.

Planned deviations from the original study, represented in the difference maps between reproduced and original figures 4 and 5, demonstrated moderate discrepancies. The southern part of Malawi exhibited significant differences in both adaptive capacity and vulnerability, with potential sources of uncertainty ranging from incorrect sign attribution to subjective data exclusions and georeferencing problems.

Unplanned deviations from the protocol were necessary due to the lack of access to the original DHS data, leading to the use of pre-aggregated, publicly accessible adaptive capacity data. Subjective weighting in the original study and ambiguity in variable transformations further contributed to uncertainties in the reproduction. The reproduction study, despite challenges, provided valuable insights into the complexities of replicating climate vulnerability research, underscoring the importance of transparency, standardized practices, and enhanced data accessibility for more credible vulnerability assessments. It goes to show how important it is that any and all subjective/ambiguous decisions are clearly communicated, that data and code is made as accessible as possible, and that reproduction studies are just as important as original studies for validating their accuracy from another perspective and computational environment
