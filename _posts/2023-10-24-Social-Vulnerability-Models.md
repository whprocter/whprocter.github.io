# The Importance of Reproducing Social Vulnerability Models: Discussing the Use of Subjective Weightings in Multi-Criteria Models

Social vulnerability models, adaptive capacity models, and resilience models are all multi-criteria models that help measure and understand complex systems and their components. These models are often used to identify and address social and environmental issues, such as poverty, climate change, and natural disasters. However, the question arises whether it is important to be able to reproduce or replicate these models.  My first thoughts on these are that they are all similarly named and are often confused in the literature, especially by the work of Malcomb et al. (2014), who referred to resilience, vulnerability, and adaptie capacity interchangeably when in fact the Asssociation of American Geographers has specific definitions for each one.

Reproducing or replicating models is essential for ensuring their accuracy and reliability. It allows researchers to test the validity of the models and identify any errors or biases that may be present. Moreover, it enables policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the models' results. However, it is crucial to note that people often use subjective weightings to weight different components of multi-criteria models, which can influence the models' outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to be transparent about the assumptions and values that underpin the models and to involve stakeholders in the modeling process.

## Importance of Reproducibility in Social Vulnerability Models

### Conceptual Clarification of Reproducibility and Replication 

Reproducibility and replication are two key concepts in scientific research that are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Reproducibility refers to the ability to obtain the same results using the same methods and data, while replication refers to the ability to obtain similar results using different methods or data. In the context of social vulnerability models, it is important to be able to reproduce and replicate these models to ensure their validity and reliability.

### Benefits of Reproducibility in Scientific Research

Reproducibility is crucial in scientific research as it ensures that the results are reliable and can be trusted. By reproducing social vulnerability models, researchers can verify the accuracy of the models and identify any errors or biases that may have been introduced. This can lead to improvements in the models and ultimately enhance their usefulness in informing policy decisions.  These types of models use **lots of data and lots of variables** (combining demographic factors, physical environment factors, policy factors, etc all together for an entire region of geographic units), and thus things can easily go awry; oftentimes minute differences in computational environment, packages used, and even where you store your files can impact your results.  Thus, reproduction is an important tool to make sure these models are consistent and can consistently be applied.


### Challenges and Limitations of Reproducing Models 

Reproducing social vulnerability models can be challenging due to the subjective nature of the data used in these models. Multi-criteria models often require subjective weightings to be applied to different components, which can vary depending on the researcher's perspective. This subjectivity can make it difficult to reproduce the models accurately, as different researchers may apply different weightings to the components.

In conclusion, the ability to reproduce and replicate social vulnerability models is crucial in ensuring their validity and reliability. While there may be challenges and limitations to reproducing these models, it is important for researchers to strive towards reproducibility to enhance the usefulness of these models in informing policy decisions.

## Role of Subjectivity in Multi-Criteria Models

### Understanding Subjective Weightings

Multi-criteria models are designed to evaluate complex systems by considering multiple factors. However, assigning weight to each factor is subjective and can vary from person to person. Therefore, it is important to understand the subjective weightings of different components to ensure that the model is reliable.

### Implications of Subjectivity on Model Reliability 

Subjectivity in multi-criteria models can have significant implications on the reliability of the model. For instance, if the weightings assigned to different components are not consistent, the model's output may be unreliable. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the weightings are standardized and consistent across different users.  I feel like in every index model study I read, such as Malcomb et al. (2014), they always mention that they "weighted" the components of the model in some fashion without any justification for it.  It is super important that we establish reproducible practices for weighting especially to know how and why a model is weighted as it is...this is especially important to ensure models are not used for p-hacking.

### Standardization vs. Flexibility in Model Design

Standardization and flexibility are two conflicting design principles for multi-criteria models. Standardization ensures that the weightings assigned to different components are consistent across users, while flexibility allows users to assign weightings based on their subjective preferences. Striking a balance between these two principles is crucial to ensure that the model is reliable and useful. 

Overall, understanding the role of subjectivity in multi-criteria models is crucial to ensure that the model is reliable and useful. By understanding the subjective weightings, implications of subjectivity on model reliability, and the balance between standardization and flexibility, users can ensure that the model is consistent and reliable.

## Importance of using both social vulnerability and hazard modelling to develop a holistic model

Cutter et al. (2003) suggested the importance of integrating social vulnerability indices, particularly in the context of modeling vulnerability to climate change, with data on the frequency and severity of hazards.  It is rarely just the social or rarely just the environmental that puts a group of marginalized people at risk, but rather a specific combination of the two.  Additionally, it is important to not overlook a group's lack of vulnerability in one of these areas and assume that they have no vulnerabilities whatsoever, since social vulnerability and hazard vulnerability can also be quite separate.
